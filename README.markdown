==============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/hybrid-vectors.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/hybrid-vectors)

Hybrid vectors e.g. mixed unboxed/boxed vectors.

This can be used to run algorithms such as those from `vector-algorithms` over a mixture of boxed and unboxed data.
